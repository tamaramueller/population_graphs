Tutorials, applications
=========================

These tutorials present real-life applications of the :mod:`pykeops.numpy`
and :mod:`pykeops.torch` modules,
from Gaussian processes to Optimal Transport theory and K-means clustering.

.. note::
    If you run a KeOps script for the first time, 
    the internal engine may take a **few minutes** to compile all the 
    relevant formulas.  Do not worry: this work is done **once and for all** 
    as KeOps stores the resulting *shared object* files ('.so') in a 
    :ref:`cache directory <part.cache>`.
