Using KeOps as a backend
------------------------------

KeOps can provide efficient GPU routines for high-level libraries
such as `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html>`_ 
or `GPytorch <https://gpytorch.ai/>`_:
if you'd like to see tutorials with other frameworks,
please `let us know <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues>`_.
