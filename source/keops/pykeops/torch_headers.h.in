// (Joan) : originally we included here the
// following file :
//
// #include <torch/extension.h>
//
// which amounts to include torch/all.h and torch/python.h.
// However torch/all.h is not needed, and loading only torch/python.h
// saves around 11s of compilation time.
//
// #include <torch/python.h>
//
// Furthermore, torch/python.h itself includes several files, from
// which only the two following ones are needed. This saves an extra 
// 2s of compilation time.

#include <torch/types.h>
#include <torch/csrc/utils/pybind.h>
